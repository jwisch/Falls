Falls Associates With Neurodegenerative Changes in Framework of Alzheimer Disease

Importance: Currently there are no behavioral markers with the framework of preclinical Alzheimer Disease (AD). Placing falls within this model could help family members and clinicians in their evaluation.

Objective: To determine when falls occur among cognitively normal (CN) individuals (n=83) with and without preclinical AD. 

Design: This cross-sectional study recorded falls among CN individuals over a one-year period.  Biomarkers including positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (structural and resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc)) were acquired within two years of fall evaluations for staging individuals.

Setting: All assessments were collected from CN participants enrolled in studies conducted by the Knight Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center at Washington University in Saint Louis. Tailored calendar journals recorded falls. Follow-up phone calls ensured accuracy in fall recordings.

Participants: CN participants were dichotomized by PET amyloid status (operationalized using standard cutoffs). Differences in amyloid accumulation, rs-fc intra-network signature, and hippocampal volume were compared between individuals who did or did not fall using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. Within preclinical AD participants (PET amyloid positive) the partial correlation between amyloid accumulation and rs-fc intra-network signature was compared for those who did and did not fall.

Main Outcome and Measures: 
Participants who fell had smaller hippocampal volumes than individuals who did not fall (p = 0.04). Among preclinical AD participants (amyloid positive), those who fell had a negative correlation between amyloid uptake and rs-fc intra-network signature (R=-0.75, p=0.012). A trend was seen for preclinical AD participants who did not fall with a positive correlation observed between amyloid uptake and rs-fc intra-network signature (R=0.70, p=0.081).

Conclusions and Relevance: Falls in CN older adults correlate with markers of neurodegeneration. Participants who did not fall had either high amyloid and high intra-network connectivity or low amyloid and low intra-network connectivity. CN individuals with preclinical AD (elevated high amyloid) and a reduced rs-fc intra-network signature appeared most likely to fall. The presence of falls in CN participants most strongly correlate with markers of neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that falls occur during the neurodegeneration phase of preclinical AD.
